# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** is a fundamental concept in software design that ensures objects of a superclass can be replaced with objects of its subclasses without altering the correctness of the program. It emphasizes that subclasses should behave in a way that is consistent with their parent classes, ensuring seamless substitutability.

## Benefits of LSP

- **Improved Reliability:** Adhering to LSP ensures that derived classes do not introduce unexpected behavior, making the system more predictable.
- **Simplified Testing:** By ensuring that subclasses can replace their base class without issues, the need for extensive retesting is minimized.
- **Better Reusability:** Classes designed with LSP in mind are easier to reuse because they follow predictable and consistent behavior.

## When to Apply LSP

- **Subclass Responsibilities:** When creating subclasses, ensure they fulfill all the guarantees made by the parent class. Avoid overriding methods in a way that changes the intended behavior.
- **Method Contracts:** Subclasses should honor the method contracts (preconditions, postconditions, and invariants) of the base class to prevent unexpected results.
- **Replacing Parent Classes:** If replacing a parent class with a subclass causes failures or changes expected outcomes, itâ€™s a sign that LSP is being violated.

## Common Misconceptions

- **Exact Same Behavior?** - LSP does not require subclasses to behave identically to their parent class. Instead, it ensures that subclasses do not violate the expectations set by the parent class.
- **No Overriding Methods?** - Overriding is allowed as long as the overridden methods respect the original behavior and guarantees of the parent class.

**Follow LSP to build robust, scalable, and easily extendable systems where inheritance strengthens rather than complicates your code!**
