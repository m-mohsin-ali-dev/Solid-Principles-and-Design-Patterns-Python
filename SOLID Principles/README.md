# SOLID Principles

## Overview
SOLID principles are five design principles aimed at improving the readability, flexibility, and maintainability of object-oriented software designs. These principles are essential for developing high-quality software that is easy to modify and extend.

| **Principle**                       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                    |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** | A class should have only one reason to change, indicating it should have one job or responsibility.                                                              |
| **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**     | Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This principle encourages extending functionality without altering existing code.       |
| **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** | Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program, ensuring subclasses can stand in for their parent classes. |
| **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** | Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This promotes creating smaller, more specific interfaces instead of one large, general-purpose interface. |
| **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** | High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions, encouraging the use of interfaces or abstract classes for loose coupling. |
