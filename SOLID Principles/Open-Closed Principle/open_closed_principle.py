The above class Shape violates open-closed principle because it cannot be closed against new type of shapes.If we add 
a new shape (e.g., triangle) we would need to modify the calculate_area function. You see, for every new shape, a new

complex, you will see that the if statement would be repeated over and over again in the calculate_area function each 
time a new shape is added, all over the application.

Shape now has a virtual method calculate_area. We have each shape extend the
Shape class and implement the virtual calculate_area method.

Every shape adds its own implementation on how it calculates an area in the
calculate_area. We iterate through the array of shape and just calls its
calculate_area method.

Now, if we add a new shape, calculate_area doesnâ€™t need to change.  All we need
to do is add the new shape to the shape array.

calculate_area now conforms to the OCP principle.
