### Creational Design Patterns
Creational patterns simplify object creation by separating the instantiation process from the client code. This makes systems more flexible, scalable, and easier to maintain.

| **Pattern**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Builder**              | Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, so that the same construction process can create different representations.             |
| **Factory Method**       | Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.                                                 |
| **Abstract Factory**     | Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.                                           |
| **Prototype**            | Create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.                                                                                      |
| **Singleton**            | Ensure a class only has one instance and provide a global point of access to it.                                                                               |
